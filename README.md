#   Daily Planner Project



#   Decription

    This is my homework project for week five. The task was to create a daily planner for the user to store their daily to-do list on. The user can type their in their schedule for each hour, and save it to view throughtout the day. The hour blocks change color to indicate which hour block is in the past, present, or future at the time of viewing the application.
